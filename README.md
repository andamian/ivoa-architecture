# IVOA Architecture Endorsed Note 2019

This is the home for the IVOA Architecture Note that is produced by the Technical 
Coordination Group (TCG). This document was created and is updated periodically to
describe the design concepts behind existing and new IVOA standards. The original
note was published in 2010 and this 2019 update is the first since that date.

# Status

Under development.

# Working on this Document

Since authoring a document on github is an experiment, this is a little bumpy... The ivoatex
toolkit normally relies on some subversion import magic to make it look local. The easy Linux way to fake that is to create a symlink, e.g. 

ivoatex -> ivoatex -> ../../volute.svn/ivoapub/ivoatex/

Then: run "make" and hope you have all the necessary tools installed.
