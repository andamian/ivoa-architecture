# IVOA Architecture Endorsed Note 2021

This is the home for the IVOA Architecture Note that is produced by the Technical 
Coordination Group (TCG). This document was created and is updated periodically to
describe the design concepts behind existing and new IVOA standards. The original
note was published in 2010 and updated in 2021. The document is expected to be updated
approximately once every three (3) years around the end of a TCG chair's term.
